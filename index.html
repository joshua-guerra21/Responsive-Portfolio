<p class="text"> My name is Joshua Guerra. I'm born and raised in Austin, TX. I'm currently looking to solidify myslef in web development.
Currently learning full stack devolopment at the University of Texas bootcamp.
Current experience has mostly been in the service industry. 7 years of serving/bartending/running events.
Am very used to fast pace working enviroment. In my service industry experience I've learned how to adapt and think on the fly as no day is the same.
I look to further my knowledge of web development and hope to find a career in this new industry</p>

<p class="text">I have a greyhound/box mix dog named Jefe that I adopted from Austin's pet's Alive and 1 orange cat that I acrquired from a friend who wasn't
able to take care of it
